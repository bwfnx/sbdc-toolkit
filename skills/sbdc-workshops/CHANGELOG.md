# Changelog

## v1.4
- first-run setup (SKILL.md step 0): org.json holds name, presenter, colors, logo, sign-up link, service area, certifications and funding notice; the deck engine, Session 1 example and both Apps Scripts read it. Maryland output unchanged byte-for-byte
- drive renames: use the drive connector's update_file

## v1.3
- moved from bwfnx/agent-skills into bwfnx/sbdc-toolkit; this is now the only copy

## v1.2
- session 2 audit: check each pasted drive id's title and each test-email attachment filename (not just the count), one question per form field, scripted checkpoint pause, submit call at :20, audit reads answers from the sent follow-up emails when the form has no sheet

## v1.1
- delivery rules from the session 1 audit: link in chat at minute 0, "don't submit until the last slide", checkpoints cut last, hard stop 5 minutes early, leftovers row from session 2 on, fact-check the speaker notes, post-class audit step

## v1.0
- initial release, built from the govcon series session 1 rebuild (business development lifecycle, sept 28, 2026)
- deck engine: maryland sbdc design system, fixed 16:9 stage, click-by-click reveal, worksheet qr checkpoints, presenter window with notes and timer, print-to-pdf with every step shown
- form builder template with a guard that refuses to rebuild a form that already has responses
- follow-up email template: attendee's own answers, links, advising button, handout and deck pdf attached, test / preview / resend functions
- tested on session 1: 31-slide deck, live form, test and real-response preview emails received with both attachments
